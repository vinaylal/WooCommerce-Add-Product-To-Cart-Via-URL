== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use this plugin? =

1. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE WOOCOMMERCE INSTALLED FIRST
2. Add the shortcode [wc-cart-url-form] to the content of the page with which you want to display the URL Creation Form. You can learn to add a shortcode here, https://betterdeveloperdocs.com/how-to-add-a-shortcode-to-a-page-or-post-in-wordpress-editor/
3. Load that page in the browser. You must have CMS login credentials in order to access.
4. Use the form to select products and quantities (to be loaded in the users cart) and hit 'Go'. This will create the URL.
5. Use that URL to create a clickable button or send that URL to the user of your choice (perhaps via email but could be anything even WhatsApp).
6. They then click that URL.
7. This will load the checkout page for WooCommerce with the products and quantities you pre-selected in the users cart. They can then simply add their payment and delivery details and they can buy those pre-selected products straight away without having to scroll through your site and shop for them all individually.
